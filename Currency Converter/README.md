## Overview

### The Challenge

Throughout the development of this project, I faced several intriguing challenges:

- **Responsive Design:** Ensuring that users have an optimal viewing experience on devices of all sizes was paramount. The interface adapts seamlessly to various screen dimensions, making it user-friendly on desktops, tablets, and mobiles.

- **Efficient API Usage:** To make the application sustainable, I optimized API usage by minimizing unnecessary fetch requests. The API imposes limits, and I've made sure to stay within the provided limit (1000 fetches).
